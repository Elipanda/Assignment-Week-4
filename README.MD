In Part 1 of my script, I have loaded all the complete feature list and the test data frames of interest, renaming the columns according to what they contain. Before binding the columns together, I have chosen the columns of x_test according to what asked in Point 2. 
In Part 2, I have done the same thing as in Part 1, but for the train data frames, and then I have merged the train and test data frames (data_fin), as asked in Point 1.
In Part 3, with an if condition, I have used descriptive activity names, such as walking etc, to describe the variable Activity.
In Part 4, I have labelled the activities according to their corresponding numbers.
In Part 5, I have aggregated the information according to what asked and created the file with the second data frame.
